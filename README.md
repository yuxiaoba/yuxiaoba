I am a 3nd year Ph.D. candidate at Sun Yat-Sen University, advised by Professor Pengfei Chen. I am interested in cloud native, microservice, Serverless, and AIOps. My research focus on managing large-scale cloud-native systems in heterogeneous computing continuum, improving their reliability, performance and resource efficiency. And I have a strong curiosity about telemetry of cloud-native systems.

I have awarded Tencent Rhino-Bird Research Elite Program and Tencent Special Scholarship in 2022. I am a Ph.D. software engineering student researcher at WeChat in 2022, hosted by Yuetang Deng.

I am actively looking for faculty positions and post-doc opportunities in both China and North America.

I maintain a Github project about [Awesome cloud paper](https://github.com/IntelligentDDS/awesome-papers) and a WeChat public account [WeeklyCloudPaper](https://yuxiaoba.github.io/authors/admin/weeklycloudpaper.jpg) in Chinese. Welcome to follow my updates.
